# EV Barbie Chatbot

Welcome to the EV Barbie Chatbot project! This interactive chatbot is designed to assist you in exploring and purchasing electric vehicles (EV) by responding dynamically to your emotions. Using advanced language models from LangChain and the intuitive interface capabilities of Streamlit, the EV Barbie Chatbot offers a user-friendly and engaging shopping experience.

## Features

- **Emotion Detection**: The chatbot analyzes the user's emotional tone to tailor responses and provide a personalized experience.
- **EV Information**: Provides detailed information on various electric vehicles, including specs, pricing, and environmental benefits.
- **Interactive UI**: Built with Streamlit, the interface is clean and simple, making it easy for users of all ages to navigate.
- **Persona Mimicry**: The chatbot mimics the friendly and supportive personality of Barbie to make the car buying process fun and engaging.

## How It Works

The chatbot uses a combination of LangChain for processing natural language and understanding user emotions, and Streamlit for creating a responsive web interface. Here’s a brief on how these components work together:
- **LangChain**: Handles all backend language understanding tasks, emotion detection, and response generation.
- **Streamlit**: Provides the frontend interface that interacts with the user, displaying responses and collecting user inputs.
